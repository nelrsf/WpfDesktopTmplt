## üõ† Customization Guide

### Adding New Windows Layout Commands

1. Create a new command class in `Infrastructure/Commands/Window`:
```csharp
public class NewLayoutCommand : ArrangeCommandBase, ICommand
{
    public event EventHandler? CanExecuteChanged;
    
    public bool CanExecute(object? parameter) => true;

    public void Execute(object? parameter)
    {
        if (!(parameter is MainWindow mainWindow))
            return;

        // Implement your layout logic here
    }
}
```

2. Register the command in `CommandDictionary.cs`:
```csharp
public class CommandDictionary : ICommandDictionary
{
    public static readonly int NewCommand = 4; // Add new constant
    
    private void initializeCommands()
    {
        dictionary.Add(NewCommand, new NewLayoutCommand());
    }
}
```

### Adding New Modules

1. Create a new UserControl in `Presentation/Controls`:
```xaml
<UserControl x:Class="WpfApp2.Presentation.Controls.NewModule"
             xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">
    <Grid>
        <!-- Your module content here -->
    </Grid>
</UserControl>
```

2. Add the module to MainWindow.xaml:
```xaml
<avalondock:LayoutDocument Title="New Module" CanClose="True">
    <controls:NewModule/>
</avalondock:LayoutDocument>
```
